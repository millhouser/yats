**y**ET **a**NOTHER **t**EMPERATURE **s**ENSOR (Surprise...)

Sorry for the name. Maybe some day I'll have a better idea and even want to rename the project.

I was bored at home, so I bought a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W (2 Watts? Would be really cool :smirk: ), a Waveshare Pico-OLED-1.3 and one of these DHT22 sensors. Stuck all together and started coding.
